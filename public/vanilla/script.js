/*
	alright to make power ups we can take createword() and add an ID parameter and if 0, spawn normal wordboxes, if 1-5 or something it'll spawn a wordbox that correlates to a powerup function.
	an ID of 1 can be nuke, and it'll just go loop through wordboxes foreach(wordbox) and assign .killed to them all, and increase score for each. could add a visual effect via the function.
	an id of 2 can be a healing wordbox and provides a heart back(possibly an overflow of hearts even IE hearts>3)
	an id of 3 can be a slowdown for the words, and all it will have to do is setinterval and change difficulty/boss to a slower speed before bringing it back to normal.
	an id of 4 can reduce word lengths by changing bosslength/normlength, or even change amount of words in each box.
	an id of 5 can do ....
	
	once the wordboxes have appropriate ID's, you just make it so the event listener checks for "if this word is typed and it has X ID, go to Y action".
	
	it's quite a simple game so we can modify parameters to make it more unique, like the word spawning directional cardinality can be modifed to spawn from any side, adding chaos to the game
	
	a difficulty slider should be initialzied at the beggining and then call the gameloop(). the slider should be like easy medium hard and we'll set the param according.
	to make the difficulty change over time we can do a difficulty=difficulty-score*10, or something similar to speed up word generation or normlength=normlength+(score%10). 
		THE IDEA IS TO NOT MAKE THE GAME LAST TOO LONG, BUT NOT BE SUPER HARD FROM THER START, LIKE A 3-10MINUTE MATCH MAX.
	
	sound effects should be added to each type of action accordingly (a nuke should make a boom or something, a right typed word should make a ping, gaining a heart should make a heartbeat or something).
	
	a lot of the game hinges on the createword function, and it looks quite simple but we can create supportive functions to make the game feel more like a game and more unique while adding 
	complexity, like adding an effect of a "bullet" going to the wordBox that is typed and applying the .killed, and then the sound effect can be twofold, the right typed word can make a 
	gunshot noise, the .killed application could be a hit marker noise or a small impact noise.
	
	the boxes for a prototype should be fine however we can either pretty the game up by making the boxes and background grids pretty/neon. or we cna add sprites and images (like squirels falling down are the wordboxes
	and the background of the webpage can be a forest and the game-container can be a similar forest or a car being protected from wildlife or something goofy, or the game can be meteorites falling down)
